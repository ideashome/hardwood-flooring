<p>Regarding the T-shirt part of the question. Going to flag this question for now as it has more to do with copyright than it does Pokemon however Ill still provide an answer that I believe is correct here. Other examples include Gloom possibly Seel Abra Kadabra Alakazam Golem and Weezing Ekans Arbok and Rotom are words spelled backwards. Yes they are copyrighted. Omz22q0ox9edwm.</p>
