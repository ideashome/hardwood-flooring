<p>On older homes with hardwood floors if the cabinets are removed they may need to be refinished anyway since the floors usually are never sanded and stained under the cabinets but it beats a tie in and refinish. Unlike natural hardwood flooring engineered wont warp or expand due to the heat of your oven. Mark the cabinet locations and install the flooring in the same direction as the majority of the base cabinets making it easier for repairing the flooring at a later date if necessary. Cabinets styles will come and go and they over time they need to be replaced from wear and tear. Plan 24374tw Interior Design Kitchen Kitchen Flooring Kitchen Interior.</p>
