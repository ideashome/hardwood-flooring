<p>These two elements combined present you with an engineered wooden floor. When it comes to engineered the wear layer thickness and the core compatibility makes a difference. The wear layer of your floor refers to the material above the tongue and groove the part that you walk on.

<p>It ranges from 1mm to 8mm thick depending on the quality of the flooring. Floors with a wear layer less than 2 millimeters thick can tolerate a light scuff-sanding with a buffer.

However most engineered floors are made with a very thin layer equivalent to only 3 sheets of paper. 150mm X 600mm Golden Brushed And Uv Oiled Click Herringbone Engineered Oak Wood Flooring 14 3mm Herringbone Wood Floor Herringbone Wood Engineered Wood Floors.</p>
