<p><strong>Wood Floor Thickness Underfloor Heating</strong>, As wood is a good insulator against heat engineered hardwood floors thickness and density can decrease the effectivity of underfloor heating. Thick wooden floors will reduce the amount of heat passing from the heated slab underneath to the room above. In the design stage calculations of the heating requirements for the building will define if the underfloor heating will perform satisfactorily as the only source of heating. Flooring of more than 20mm thick is not recommended.</p>
