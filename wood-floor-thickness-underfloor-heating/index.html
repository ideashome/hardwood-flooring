<p><strong>Wood Floor Thickness Underfloor Heating</strong>, As wood is a good insulator against heat engineered hardwood floors thickness and density can decrease the effectivity of underfloor heating. Thick wooden floors will reduce the amount of heat passing from the heated slab underneath to the room above. In the design stage calculations of the heating requirements for the building will define if the underfloor heating will perform satisfactorily as the only source of heating. Flooring of more than 20mm thick is not recommended.</p>

Solid wood flooring on the other hand is quite likely to develop unsightly gaps and may even cup or bow depending on the quality of the floor and how it has been fitted. The efficiency of heating depends on the type of wood hardness resistance stability the thickness of the solid wood layer 10 - 20mm insulation type of heating system and the type of heating main or additional heating.</p>
