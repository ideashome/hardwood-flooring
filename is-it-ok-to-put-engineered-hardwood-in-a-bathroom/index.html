<p>Of all hardwood flooring options engineered is a better choice for a bathroom than solid as plywood or solid wood bottom layers hold up against moisture relatively well and are very dimensionally stable. Its just important to note that more care will be needed then say that of laminate. An engineered hardwood floor could hold up well in spacious. Solid wood has the tendency to shrink and expand as humidity. Medium Gray Oak Wire Brushed Water Resistant Engineered Hardwood Water Resistant Flooring Engineered Hardwood Waterproof Flooring.</p>

<p>Hardwood is a better bathroom flooring choice than say carpet but it can still be very problematic. In short moisture will destroy a solid hardwood floor sooner or later probably sooner in bathrooms that get heavy use. We cant speak first hand on solid hardwood in a bathroom since we dont have experience with that. Always read the product literature carefully if you plan to install wood flooring in a bathroom or other damp area.
