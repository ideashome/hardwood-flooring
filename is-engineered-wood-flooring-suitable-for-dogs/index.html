<p>If timber floors are caught in time they can be recoated which can be done at a fraction of the cost of a sand and polish. That is why you should avoid using the engineered hardwood if you have pets in your house. The second reason for not choosing an engineered hardwood species is that if your pet wets the floor the materials in the engineered would absorb and react with the uric acid. The finish of your floor is its protection on the surface and within the whole construction it is the barrier between bare wood that is prone to damages to some extend and the environment be it high traffic water damages moisture.
