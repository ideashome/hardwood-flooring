<p>The phrase emerged out the Active Design Guidelines which was a manual originally published by the City of New York in 2010 to guide the creation of health-promoting buildings streets and urban spaces based on the latest academic research and best practices. This guide provides recommendations to help you develop an AD DS deployment strategy based on the requirements of your organization and the particular design that you want to create. To put this into context if a passive design provides ventilation and heating using natural non powered systems a building using active design will achieve the same end but have to use technologies such as solar panels heat recovery systems or the use of renewable energy sources such as wind turbines.
