<p>In some cases this may be true but ultimately you get around the same number of sandings even though solid is usually around 34 thick. Most of the engineered hardwoods installed in the Austin area are glued directly to the concrete slab.

<p>Overall both 10mm and 12mm are good choices with 12mm being closer to hardwood. This ranges in thickness depending on the quality of the flooring but is typically between 3-7mm although thicknesses of up to 15mm are available.

Depending on the thickness of the veneer some engineered wood flooring can be refinished as many times as solid hardwood flooring.
