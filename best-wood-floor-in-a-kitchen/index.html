<p>Tile flooring is going to be the better choice when it comes to kitchen flooring. Please also note that I would strongly recommend unfinished hardwood over pre-finished hardwood for kitchens. Moisture-cured urethane is also particularly moisture resistant and durable making it a great choice for a kitchen floor. Especially those that mimic traditional hardwood floors with planks and grain finish details. Pin By Michelle Lung On Flooring Wood Flooring Options House Flooring Wood Floor Kitchen.</p>
