<p>Access and Aggregation networks are facing relentless pressure to cost effectively expand capacity to meet the ever-rising bandwidth demands from end users. In a tool for use by network planners in designing metropolitan IP aggregation networks several optimization methods. In small networks uplink speeds of about 1Gbps might even become satisfactory depending on the total number of user devices which would be served by each wiring closet and the application demands on the network.

<p>Another advantage is the ease of adding additional hardware and capacity. The choice of an appropriate architectural approach and sizing model for the aggregation network is studied in this paper through cost optimization models which encompass as-pects of non-stop delivery service ﬂexibility policy management and cost allocation. You have thousands of unique customers or unique ship-to locations and you typically group these by geography. Outsourcing Few medium to large. We are using the term customer to refer to ship product to the locations so if we ship product to a firm with ten customers we are talking about the ten locations.</p>
