Mechanical Fastener Selection Staples or cleats may be used for our other flooring however be aware that all cleats are made to install wood flooring only certain staples are made exclusively for use with flooring. Continue to install the flooring making sure to nailstaple 1-2 from the ends and every 3 4 thereafter.
