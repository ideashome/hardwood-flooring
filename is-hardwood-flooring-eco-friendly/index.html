<p>Use organic materials such as organic sheets eco-friendly paint etc. Since our home was stripped down to the subfloors when we purchased it we didnt have the option of restoring the original floors. Our green flooring is non-toxic environmentally-friendly and made from sustainably harvested recycled or reclaimed sources. If you are looking for a truly environmentally friendly flooring option then check with your supplier about the origins and sustainability of the wood.
