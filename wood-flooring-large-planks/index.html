<p>About Wide Plank Wood Flooring. We believe the use of wider and longer length planks reduces the number of end and edge seams creating a more authentic looking floor. These imposing planks truly accentuate a big space but they are equally as well suited to a small one since fewer joins mean a cleaner visual. There is a simplicity to this style of wood flooring that is as satisfying as it is aesthetically pleasing and few styles can show off the natural characteristics of the wood quite as well as long plank flooring.
