<p><strong>Agile User Centered Design</strong>, Get users involved in the design process and understand what they think about your product is the essential way to know if your product works or not. Agile development is not just about being fast but iterate and build products that users like in a fast-paced environment. In contrast to traditional approaches that emphasize requirements analysis design and implementation as distinct phases Agile methods seek to minimize up-front planning in favor of producing working code quickly and often. Because Agile development is highly feedback-driven product teams may rely on user opinion in situations where user observation is more appropriate.</p>
