<p>Engineered flooring is more durable brings more value to your home and feels more like real wood. Engineered wood flooring is characterised by a top wear layer of hardwood like oak or walnut. The industry standard for engineered flooring is 3 wide by 3 long. Floors like our engineered white oak wood flooring have 9 to 11 plies or sub layers depending on the overall thickness of the floor while the industry standard is 3 to 5 plies. Engineered wood flooring is able to be laid with marginal gaps intentionally provided for natural contraction and expansion which occurs with far less significance in the layered floating structure than in solid floorboards.</p>

<p>Engineered wood floors are perfect for most rooms in the house apart from bathrooms thanks to their top layer of real wood - this makes them work well with any decor that would work with a traditional wood flooring without the price tag and intensive maintenance. The top of each plank is 100 wood available in a variety of species and on-trend styles. Engineered wood flooring creates the look of real wood using layers of compressed timber to create a solid board without the added cost of its premium counterpart. High-quality laminate flooring can be textured but you wont mistake the two as its glossier.
