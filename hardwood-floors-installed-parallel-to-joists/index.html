<p><strong>Hardwood Floors Installed Parallel To Joists</strong>, To answer directly the question Yes it is entirely possible to install hardwood flooring directly on top of the joists. The I-joists span 10 max they are able to span 16 and are supported by the rim joists on the sides and 2 large girders.
