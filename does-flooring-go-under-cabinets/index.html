<p>Floor covering or finish flooring is the surface that you see and walk on not the subfloor under the underlayment. This hardwood is specifically stained and texturized to accent the Oaks wood grain pattern. Remove the cabinets and screw a plywood filler piece to the subfloor about ½ inch inside the line where it will be under the cabinets. A floating floor goes in AFTER the cabinets.

<p>Laminate flooring is a floating floor so we do not recommend installing kitchen cabinets on top of laminate as they could pin the floor down and prevent it from expanding and contracting with temperature changes leading to buckling and separation at the joints. Rob In general the flooring should go under the cabinets assuming its hardwood or tile and its nailed or glued. And the newer vinyl planks are having issues with this reduced expansion gap. A new floor should always go under the cabinets. Xrp Waterproof Flooring Cabinets To Go Cabinets To Go Flooring Waterproof Flooring.</p>
