<p>Why get in that soup if you dont have to. If you do not like plain stairs another option is to use a thin runner. As long as the sides of the stairs still match the rest of the floor it wont seem out of place. Using the same carpet creates a visual link to what lies above and gives you a safe way to travel between the two levels.

<p>Another solution is to coordinate only one or two stair parts to match your floor exactly. Match the hardwood floors of your upstairs and downstairs. Using the same carpet creates a visual link to what lies above and gives you a safe way to travel between the two levels. I contracted to have the old carpet runner removed and my 14-step stairs sanded and stained but the color of stain used under 2 coats of water-based polyurethane does NOT match the red oak hardwood flooring on my first and second floors.
