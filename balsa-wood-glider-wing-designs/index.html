<p><strong>Balsa Wood Glider Wing Designs</strong>, An airfoil is a cross-section of a planegliders wing. The Balsa Wood Glider project proposes to create a functional glider out of 20in by 3in rectangle of Balsa Wood. Because of Bernoullis principle air flowing around a well made airfoil generates lift. The point where the weight of the glider acts is termed as centre of gravity CG.</p>
