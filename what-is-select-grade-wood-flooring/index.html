<p>Maple hardwood flooring comes in several grades which identify the quality of the woods appearance. Flooring manufacturers have their own grading standards others may also comply with national grading rules and some flooring styles have no grade at all antique flooring for example. This grade of solid hardwood is what our flooring professionals always recommend installing. Rustic grade hardwood sometimes is called 2 tavern or cabin grade flooring. 4 1 4 Select Grade White Oak Floors With 3 Coats Of Water Base Finish House Flooring White Oak Floors Oak Floors.</p>

<p>1 Common grade and the reverse side the better side grades FAS. Again color variation with exotic flooring is not a defect but rather a beautiful characteristic of the flooring. Wood that has been graded natural or character grade means that the wood will feature some knots as well as some colour variation and sap all of which add to its natural charm. Known as either select or classic grade typically this will have a mix of almost prime boards with other planks which have more knots.
