<p>Yes you can install hardwood in a basement as long as there is not a water nor moisture issue. In Westchester NY many basements are below grade andor constructed directly on the slab. You have many options as to what can you put in a finished basement and you should really consult as always a professional about what can you do but I have great news for those of you who dont want carpet in the basement and want hardwood. There is simply too much moisture present in basements to comfortably install solid hardwood flooring.
