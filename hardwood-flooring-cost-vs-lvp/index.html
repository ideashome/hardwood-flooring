<p>The average cost of vinyl floor tiles or planks is about 3 per square foot and the average installation cost is 250 per square foot for a total of 550 per square foot. Although market demand influences prices many exotic wood-look styles cost the same as other plank designs because LVP can be printed to look like virtually any wood species. Laminate is relatively similar high-end vinyl plank can cost a good deal more. Luxury Vinyl Tile costs range from 200 to 500 per square foot and can last for years. Pin On Laundryrenoideas.</p>
