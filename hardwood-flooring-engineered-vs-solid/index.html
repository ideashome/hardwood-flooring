<p><strong>Hardwood Flooring Engineered Vs Solid</strong>, Pros and Cons of Engineered Hardwood vs Hardwood Floors. This approach saves more forests because each tree of the hardwood the oak maple bamboo etc can go further than it does with traditional solid wood floors. Solid hardwood offers more flexibility longevity and durability while stable engineered floors are more suitable for humid locations and installations against concrete slabs. Engineered hardwood is better for more intricate designs or patterns while solid hardwood is best for a natural wood floor appearance.</p>

This is due to increased awareness of sustainability and the need to reduce deforestation and changes in the market such as using underfloor heating people wanting wider floor boards etc. Hardwood floors can add beauty and value to any home. Engineered flooring does give you the ability to go with a wider board but your relative humidity levels must be controlled to relatively the same level as solid hardwood flooring.</p>

<p>It generally is 34 in thickness. Expect a solid hardwood floor to give you anywhere between 80 to 100 years service compared to around 50 years for a well-looked-after engineered floor. Engineered hardwood is more forgiving with moisture as its more stable. Solid hardwood is generally more costly because of the amount of solid wood that is used for each plank of flooring. Because it is solid all the way through solid hardwood flooring can be sanded and refinished several times giving a new lease of life each time and therefore a longer lifespan.</p>

<p>When solid hardwood flooring is in an environment where the humidity level is over 55 then it will absorb the excess moisture and cupping will happen. Yes typically if you are comparing say a solid red oak hardwood floor with a similar red oak engineered floor then the solid red oak will be more expensive. Extreme temperature changes high humidity and excessive moisture will cause the planks to expand and contract resulting in gaps between the planks referred to as cupping. Because of the way engineered hardwood is processed it is not as affected by humidity as solid wood planks are.
