<p>Utilising the advantage that our combined aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics experience brings to motorsport. And when a solid bridge floor is framed into the solid webs of such plate girders the resulting cross-section is peculiarly sensitive to aerodynamic effects even in a steady wind particularly if the span is highly flexible. Long span suspension bridges are flexible structures which are highly sensitive to the action of the wind hence aerodynamic performance often becomes a governing factor in the design process. Proximity effects are covered in Annex A.</p>

<p>Without mitigating measures the tower legs would literally start to swing from side to side in strong winds causing aerodynamic instability or bounce. The analysis of bridge aerodynamics is demonstrated using numerical simulations both with and without barriers. But nowadays some large vessels have so much superstructure above the water that they have to be designed carefully too or the ship could rock badly in high winds or even become unstable. Aerodynamics is also used to design the upper parts of large ships. Lesson Page To Go With Bridge Project Page 4 Engineering Design Process Beam Bridge Stem Teacher.</p>
